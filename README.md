This is a Client-Server application built in Java using Sockets.

To compile and run the application, firstly make sure to run these two lines of code:

```bash
$ chmod +x client.sh
$ chmod +x server.sh
```

While not necessary, this `chmod +x` allows you to...  

```
$ ./server.sh -c          # to compile
$ ./server.sh -r          # to execute
```
